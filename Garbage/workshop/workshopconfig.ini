$ITEM_NAME "Garbage transfers"
 
$ITEM_DESC "Garbage transfers with rail connections.

Bigger garbage transfers suitable for big amount of garbage. Faster loading and unloading, factory connections are usable only for mixed and hazardous waste, aggregate waste can be loaded and unloaded, but it is not transfered by factory connections.

Big transfer with railway - 4 vehicles, 2 trains, 390 tonnes
Big transfer with railway (120m) - 5 vehicles, 2 trains, 1144 tones

Warning: It seems that above 180 tonnes of garbage is garbage transfer causing pollution. The same is happening with vannila one, so it seems that threshold for causing pollution is in game directly.
